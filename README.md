#### Q4.3

Proportional probability of PA1 for PA2_test_1: 2.952445311338666e-60
Proportional probability of PA2 for PA2_test_1: 1.7389994927401387e-54

Proportional probability of PA1 for PA2_test_2: 1.2889321368699806e-110
Proportional probability of PA2 for PA2_test_2: 5.424100708836807e-102

Proportional probability of PA1 for PA2_test_3: 2.980789830276087e-111
Proportional probability of PA2 for PA2_test_3: 2.3994485823667224e-102

Proportional probability of PA1 for PA2_test_4: 3.55711346361056e-103
Proportional probability of PA2 for PA2_test_4: 5.603753997340804e-97

This correctly predicts that PA2_test 1-4 are all in PA2.

#### Q5.2

Proportional probability of PA1 for combined test data: 5e-324 with 5 multiplications that would've resulted in 0.0
Proportional probability of PA2 for combined test data: 1.874640894e-315 with 2 multiplications that would've resulted in 0.0

It appears from these numbers that it is more likely to be from PA2.  We were getting a result of 0.0, but we made adjustments to preserve the number before it would've become 0 and then kept a count of how many more multiplications needed to happen after it would've turned to 0.

#### Q5.3

Adding logarithms of a number is proportional to multiplying those numbers because the result of a logarithm is the exponent that would get the provided number, and adding exponents is the same as multiplying the bases.  Therefore, adding the logarithms of a number is proportional to multiplying those numbers.
