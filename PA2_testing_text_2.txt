Part B: Explore your models, hyperparameters, and test cross validationWrite code (in the programming language of your choice) to train your chosen models on your data. Submit to Gradescope: For each model:A brief definition/description of the modelTwo strengths and two weaknesses of the modelChosen hyperparameter for the model and the values you will testFunction call to run the model with data and a chosen hyperparameter valuePick a performance metric (or multiple metrics) to evaluate your modelsDemonstrate you can run cross-validationPick a binary classification problem and a model to testWrite code that will run 5- or 10-fold cross-validation for testing hyperparameter valuesGraph the cross validation results
