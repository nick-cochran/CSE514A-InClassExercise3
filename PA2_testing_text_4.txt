Final report: Explain your methods and draw conclusionsThe data mining work is mostly complete, well done! Now, you need to communicate your results. Remember that the goal of data mining is to obtain actionable knowledge, so your last task is to show that your work has done just that.Introduction: Explain the motivation behind analyzing this dataset.Results: Use your models to draw some conclusions. Were all three binary classification problems equally predictible? Were all the tested models equally “good”?Did dimension reduction have a meaningful (negative or positive) impact?Given the motivation, what would you recommend?Include at least one figure to support your conclusions.Methods: Explain/justify your methodsWhat values did you end up picking as hyperparameters? Explain how you decided on those valuesWhat dimension reduction method(s) did you end up using or not using? Explain how these methods work
