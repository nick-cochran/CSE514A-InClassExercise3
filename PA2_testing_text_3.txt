Part C: Choose a dimension reduction method and fit your modelsDimension reduction can have a positive or a negative impact on model performance, so its time to test it out. Submit to Gradescope: A brief description/definition of the dimension reduction method(s) you choose to use.How specifically will you apply it to cut the number of features in half?For each model:For each binary classification problem:1. Perform 5-fold cross validation on the full training dataset2. Visualize the cross validation results3. Use the best hyperparameter value to train the model on the whole training dataset4. Use the trained model to predict on the final validation set5. Report the performance and the runtime of steps 3 and 46. Redo all of the above with your dimensionally reduced datasets.
