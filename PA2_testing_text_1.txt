Part A: Explore your data and define a solvable problemYou must chose a dataset to work with. Submit to Gradescope:A brief definition/description of what the dataset is and what the variables are measuringDefine a real-world motivation for fitting a binary classification model to this dataset. What would be the response variable? Who would want these models and why?Visualize the distribution of variables. Are any of them categorical? Are any of them normally distributed?Process the dataset to create three binary classification problems. What steps did you take to define these three problems?Submit these three subsets as CSV or TSV files.
